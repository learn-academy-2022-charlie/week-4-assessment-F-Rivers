# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: In React we use properties, or props, to pass down information from a parent to a child component. 

  Researched answer: The information flows from the top or parent component, to bottom or child component, as 'read only' information. We used props in our class when passing information from the app folder to the components folder by using the syntax this.props. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is when the user interacts with the web page. DOM stands for Document Object Model and we refer to it as just 'e'. 

  Researched answer: A DOM event is used in conjunction with functions that will not run until the DOM event is triggered. The events are written with the syntax of camelCase and written inside of curly brackets {}. One example of how we can trigger the DOM event is by clicking on an element in our page and this will generate an event such as, changing the info on the page or directing you elsewhere.    


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is a manner of of programming that focuses on objects, classes and, how to alter them to best fit our needs. Meanwhile, FP is focused on functions, logic and, are unable to alter them.   

  Researched answer: Having a OOP style of programming means you're writing code in a manner that is focused on objects, hence the data being stored in objects. All focus points are a sort of blueprint, also known as a class. We use OOP in our class to make our code more dynamic. 


4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float has a decimal point and tends to be more accurate, an integer uses a whole number and can be subject to rounding, that can cause arithmetic issues.  

  Researched answer: In Ruby, a Float contains a decimal like (22.01234) meanwhile, an Integer contains only whole numbers like (22, 1, 2, 3, 4). Floats will only be the output when specifically called upon, otherwise the default is integers. 


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return is when Ruby automatically knows to run the last code of a method without being told to do so.

  Researched answer: Implicit return in Ruby is when the method being returned can run without being called upon by the "return" syntax. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: An instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each represented object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static.

2. PostgreSQL: Also known as just Postgres, it is a free and open-source object relational database management system,  which means it looks at databases through an object-oriented programming (OOP) lens.

3. Ruby on Rails: Open source development framework that is written in ruby 

4. ORM: Object Relational mapping, lets you write and alter data from a data base using object oriented programing 

5. Active Record: The model in MVC which is responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database. It is an implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object Relational Mapping system.
